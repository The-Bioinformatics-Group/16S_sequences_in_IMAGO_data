# 16S_sequences_in_IMAGO_data
Here I'm using the program V-Xtractor to identify 16S sequences in the different IMAGO genome assemblies.

# Result

### Skeletonema
The MiSeq data of strain CCMP1332 from Anja Kamp containd no bacterial 16S sequences. The HiSeq data from the strain ST54 contained four more or less full 16S sequences and four short fragments that was recognised by the V-Xtractor HMM's. The PacBio dataset contained one additional sequence un unitig_1 and 1 (Kordia sp. nov.).
